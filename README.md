# randomize-ten-thousand

This is a small repository that includes a simple project configured via NPM (Node Package Manager), Git & GitHub, and Jest for testing.

The `main.js` includes my solution to solving the problem:

```
Write a program that generates a list of 10,000 numbers in random order each time it is run. Each number in the list must be unique and be between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive).
```

My solution was implemented via TDD (Test Driven Development) and can be verified through either setting up this repository locally, or by running the code in `main.js` on it's own.
